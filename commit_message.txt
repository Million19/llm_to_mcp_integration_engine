Fix: Correct custom regex parsing and add tests

This commit addresses issues with the `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` function when used for direct regex-based parsing (`json_validation=False`).

**Fixes:**
- Resolved a `TypeError` in `core/integrator.py` by ensuring `find_tools_in_text` correctly receives a string argument.
- Updated `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` in `llm_to_mcp_integration_engine.py` to directly use provided regex patterns for parsing when `json_validation` is `False`. This bypasses the JSON-centric `integration_advance` logic, aligning with the intended behavior for custom non-JSON parsing.

**Testing:**
- Added new unit tests in `tests/test_custom_integration.py`.
- These tests cover:
    - Successful extraction of a grid using regex in `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom`.
    - The scenario where no match is found by the regex, ensuring the function returns `None` for the respective tool.

These changes ensure that the custom mode for regex-based data extraction functions correctly and is robustly tested.
The issue was initially reported by a user trying to parse a non-JSON LLM response containing a grid of numbers.
