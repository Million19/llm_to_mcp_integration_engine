Subject: Re: Issue with llm_to_mcp_integration_custom example

Hi [User's Name/Vyacheslav],

Thank you so much for reaching out and for trying out the `llm_to_mcp_integration_engine` library! I really appreciate you reporting the issue you encountered with the `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` example.

The problem you experienced was two-fold:

1.  **Initial `TypeError`**: The traceback you provided correctly pointed to a `TypeError` in `finder.py` (`expected string or bytes-like object`). This occurred because the `integration_advance` function (called by `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom`) was incorrectly passing a dictionary (the result of `extract_json_fragment`) to the `find_tools_in_text` function, which expects a string.

2.  **Underlying Logic for `custom` mode**: Even after fixing the `TypeError`, a `ValueError ("No JSON fragment found in text")` would occur. This was because the `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` function, in its previous state, was still routing the processing through `integration_advance`. The `integration_advance` function is designed to look for JSON-based tool selection directives (like `SELECTED_TOOLS`), which are not present in your `raw_llm_answer` when using the custom regex approach. The `custom` mode with `json_validation=False` is intended to bypass this JSON-centric logic and use the provided regex patterns directly.

Here's how these issues were resolved:

1.  **`TypeError` Fix**: The `integration_advance` function in `src/llm_to_mcp_integration_engine/core/integrator.py` was modified to ensure that `find_tools_in_text` receives the original `llm_response` string when the input is not a direct JSON object.

2.  **`llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` Logic Update**: The main fix was implemented in the `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` function within `src/llm_to_mcp_integration_engine/llm_to_mcp_integration_engine.py`. It now correctly checks the `json_validation` flag. When `json_validation` is `False` (as in your example), it iterates through the `tools_list`, extracts the regex `pattern` for each tool, and applies it directly to the `llm_response` string to perform the extraction. This bypasses the `integration_advance` logic entirely for such cases, aligning with the intended behavior of the custom mode for direct regex parsing.

3.  **Environment/Path Issue**: During debugging, we also found that the Python environment was sometimes loading a previously installed or cached version of the library instead of the locally modified code. This was resolved by ensuring that the local `src` directory ( `d:/GitHub/llm_to_mcp_integration_engine/src` ) is prioritized in Python's module search path (e.g., by modifying `sys.path` in the test script or setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable). This ensures that the latest changes are always picked up during execution and testing.

I've also added unit tests specifically for this regex-based grid extraction functionality in `llm_to_mcp_integration_custom` to ensure it works as expected and to prevent regressions in the future. These tests now pass, confirming the fix.

Your example code should now run correctly with these changes in place, provided your environment is loading the updated library code.

Thank you again for your valuable feedback, which has helped improve the library! Please let me know if you have any more questions or run into any other issues.

Best regards,
